"""Authority-gated Stripe spend. See SKILL.md for usage.

This script can NEVER execute an over-cap amount, under any input — there is
no --approved-by flag here, deliberately. The only way past the cap is
approve.py, which performs a real Twilio Verify check it cannot fake, then
calls the privileged executor itself. That split is the actual safety
boundary, not a convention this script could be talked out of.

Checks the kill switch (state/custodian.db, the same database kill_toggle.py
writes to) before anything else -- an operator-only override that this
script has no way to set or clear itself, only consult. Uses plain stdlib
sqlite3, not the custodian package itself, so this stays dependency-free
inside the sandbox.
