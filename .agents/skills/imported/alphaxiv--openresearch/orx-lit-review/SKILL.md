description: "Explain and compare scientific or technical concepts using original research evidence. Use before answering conceptual or architectural questions, research claims, literature reviews, or related-work requests, even when no paper, citation, or search is requested. Retrieve with relevant alphaXiv, OpenAlex, bioRxiv, and PubMed connectors; scale retrieval to the question."

# Literature retrieval

Use this skill for scientific explanations and comparisons, even without a named
paper. Never delegate retrieval to a sub-agent.

Use enabled literature connectors appropriate to the topic. General web search
is a fallback only when relevant connectors provide no useful evidence. Do not
supplement successful retrieval with a web search for a familiar or preferred
paper; use a focused connector query or `orx paper`. Opening a selected original
PDF to extract evidence is source access; opening its abstract first is unnecessary.

## Explain with visual evidence

- Prefer explaining through original figures, tables, and diagrams. For
  comparisons, choose visuals that cover the relevant alternatives; let the
  reader see the architecture, relationship, or result being explained.
- Answer as a guided reading of those visuals, presenting them early. Keep
  prose brief: what to notice, why it matters, and the caveats, grounded in
  contextual author quotations.

Visual evidence should replace standalone tutorials, generated comparison
tables, and recitations of data or structure. Choose visuals for explanatory
value, without a fixed image count. Text is the fallback when relevant sources
contain no useful visual or extraction remains blocked; explain that gap.
One unavailable figure is not a reason to omit other accessible visuals.

Each command performs one search against public endpoints and emits its
structured JSON result. No login is required:

```sh
orx discover keyword "<exact keyword query>"
orx discover embedding "<semantic description in the user's terms>"
orx discover openalex "<scholarly search query>"
orx discover biorxiv "<biology preprint query>"
orx discover pubmed "<biomedical query>"
```

- `keyword` searches title, abstract, and full text. Results include the match
  snippets that explain why each paper was retrieved. Use short exact terms:
  method names, acronyms, benchmarks, authors, or title phrases.
- `embedding` searches titles and abstracts semantically, then reranks by
  similarity and the requested priority. Use the user's actual question or a
  concise description of a genuinely missing facet.
- `openalex` searches the cross-disciplinary OpenAlex scholarly graph. It is
  especially useful for journal/conference papers, citation context, and work
  outside arXiv.
- `biorxiv` searches OpenAlex's bioRxiv source index. bioRxiv has no comparable
  native search API; the bioRxiv API is used later when reading a selected DOI.
- `pubmed` searches PubMed's biomedical and life-science journal literature
  through NCBI E-utilities, ranked by PubMed's Best Match. It
  accepts PubMed query syntax such as field tags (`[ti]`, `[au]`, `[mh]`).
  Result ids are PMIDs.
- Every primitive returns the same JSON shape: `source`, self-routing `id`,
  title, abstract, and publication date. alphaXiv results may include votes and
  full-text snippets; OpenAlex and bioRxiv results may include citations.
  PubMed results carry no votes or citations.

## Date and ranking controls

Retrieval is not date-bounded unless you supply a bound. Add the same controls
to any primitive when the question calls for them:

```sh
orx discover keyword "<query>" --published-after 2024-01-01 --prioritize recency
orx discover embedding "<query>" --published-before 2012-01-01 --prioritize historical
orx discover openalex "<query>" --published-after 2024-01-01 --prioritize recency
orx discover biorxiv "<query>" --limit 20
orx discover pubmed "<query>" --published-after 2020-01-01 --prioritize recency
```

- `--published-after` and `--published-before` are inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD`
  bounds. Do not invent a cutoff merely to favour newer work.
- Older or narrow `--published-before` embedding searches can return a thin or
  empty candidate set because the upper bound is applied after vector retrieval.
  Report what comes back; do not treat an empty set as proof that no literature
  exists or retry the identical query and window.
- `--prioritize` is `default`, `recency`, `historical`, or `popular`.
- `--limit` can narrow alphaXiv output but cannot widen alphaXiv's fixed
  server-side candidate pools. For OpenAlex, bioRxiv, and PubMed it also
  controls the requested pool size.
- OpenAlex and bioRxiv implement these controls with OpenAlex publication-date
  filters, then rerank the returned relevance pool by date or citations. Their
  ranking is best-effort and is not identical to alphaXiv's semantic,
  vote-aware ranking.
- PubMed applies the window as a publication-date filter and reranks its
  relevance pool by date for `recency` and `historical`. It has no citation
  counts, so `popular` keeps PubMed's relevance order.
- Use `recency` for explicitly new/latest work. Use `historical` for seminal or
  foundational work. Use `popular` only when the user asks about votes,
  popularity, or community standing.

## Main-agent retrieval loop

### Set up the retrieval query

1. If using keyword retrieval, build focused terms using only wording from the
   user or prior tool results. Never guess an acronym expansion. General-purpose
   padding reduces result quality.
2. For semantic or scholarly-graph retrieval, build one short faithful question
   in the user's terms rather than a padded reformulation.
3. Estimate retrieval difficulty from 1–10. This controls a budget of complete
   follow-up rounds: difficulty 1–3 gets 0 rounds, 4–7 gets 1, and 8–10 gets 2.
4. Resolve one publication window and priority for the request. Every initial
   and follow-up call must inherit those exact controls; never widen a window or
   change priority during the loop. Every returned candidate already satisfies
   that window, so rank what is available instead of lamenting well-known work
   that the user excluded.

### Run and rank

1. Choose the initial sources and strategies that fit the query. For arXiv-heavy
   ML, CS, math, or physics questions, use alphaXiv keyword, embedding, or both
   according to whether exact full-text evidence, semantic coverage, or both are
   useful. Add OpenAlex for broader journal, conference, citation, or
   cross-disciplinary coverage. Use bioRxiv for biology and adjacent
   life-science preprints and PubMed for biomedical, clinical, and
   life-science journal literature, not as ritual calls for unrelated topics.
   When the corpus is genuinely ambiguous or interdisciplinary, query multiple
   relevant sources concurrently. If the initial round includes alphaXiv
   keyword and its terms mix other terms with one or more 2–10 character tokens
   that start with a letter, contain only letters, digits, or hyphens, and have
   at least two uppercase letters, concurrently run one additional keyword call
   whose query is exactly those acronym tokens joined by spaces and nothing
   else. This recovery call is part of the initial round.
2. Treat initial calls independently: retain every successful result set when
   another call fails. If none returns results and follow-up budget remains,
   use a round only when a focused recovery query is likely to work.
3. Inspect and deduplicate every candidate. Match exact `id` first, then a DOI
   or arXiv id visible in the metadata, then exact normalized title as a
   cross-source fallback. Prefer the alphaXiv representation of an arXiv
   duplicate because it supports full-text reading. bioRxiv is a subset of
   OpenAlex, and PubMed journal records largely overlap OpenAlex, so overlap
   between those calls is expected. Within each source,
   the API order already blends topical relevance with the requested priority:
   - With `recency`, freshness is already upranked and old accumulated votes
     are damped. Reorder only for topical fit; do not exclude an older but much
     better match.
   - With `popular`, votes or citations dominate among topically plausible
     results. Keep high-impact relevant papers, but drop off-topic ones.
   - Otherwise, topical relevance remains primary with freshness and votes
     already nudging the order. Do not apply those preferences a second time.
4. If the initial candidates provide solid topical coverage, stop immediately
   and rank 5–15 IDs. Fast and slightly less complete is better than an
   exploratory search. Prefer fewer strong papers over padding.
5. Otherwise, spend at most the difficulty-derived number of follow-up rounds.
   One round targets one concrete missing acronym, method, benchmark,
   organization, title phrase, venue, or subtopic. Choose one or more sources
   based on the gap: alphaXiv keyword for exact/full-text evidence, alphaXiv
   embedding for a semantic arXiv angle, OpenAlex for broad scholarly or
   citation coverage, bioRxiv for recent biology preprints, and PubMed for
   biomedical or clinical journal literature. Later rounds do
   **not** need to query all sources. Calls for the same missing angle count
   together as one round. Never spend a round merely rephrasing an existing
   search. Re-evaluate after each round and stop as soon as coverage is
   sufficient. The budget is a hard cap, not a target.
6. Drop each selected ID that did not appear in a successful initial or
   follow-up result, retaining the surviving IDs in your chosen rank order. If
   no selected ID survives, fall back to the first 15 unique IDs in observation
   order, with initial results before follow-up results. Never invent or recall
   an ID.

Batch all facets into one broad retrieval loop and plan against a cap of two
complete loops per user turn. If a genuinely distinct topic still forces a
third or fourth loop, run it in shallow mode: initial searches only, with zero
follow-up rounds. This degradation is a backstop, not permission to plan extra
loops. Refuse a fifth loop and answer from the papers already found.

For a set-of-papers request such as “find papers,” “top papers,” “what is out
there,” or “what should I read,” return the ranked discovery results and stop.
Depth on individual papers is not part of the discovery loop. When the request
instead needs claim-level synthesis, methodological details, or comparison,
finish retrieval first and then read the 3–5 most load-bearing candidates with
`orx paper <id>` (or the number the user requested). Do not narrow to 3–5
papers before retrieval has produced its ranked 5–15 candidate set.

Do not compare alphaXiv votes numerically with OpenAlex citations; they measure
different things. Topical fit is the cross-source ranking signal.

## Reading selected papers

`orx paper` auto-detects an arXiv id/URL, bioRxiv DOI, other DOI, OpenAlex
`W…` id, or PubMed PMID/URL.
For alphaXiv it returns a compact structured report; use `--full` for
exact wording and surrounding context, even when a report exists. Without
`--full`, a missing report automatically falls back to extracted full text in the same
command. `--full` skips the report entirely rather than acting as a superset of
the default. If extracted text is also unavailable, locate the original PDF
through the returned paper link.

`orx paper` prints the alphaXiv link before the content. When alphaXiv has an
associated repository, it then prints `GitHub: <url>`. This is the most-starred
associated repository and can be a framework rather than the paper's own code,
so sanity-check it before treating it as the implementation.

All discovery and paper commands honor the user's disabled literature-source
settings; do not work around an error saying a source is disabled.

Read a paper before using it as claim-level support. Discovery lists may link
candidate titles, but must not imply that methods or findings were verified
from snippets alone.

## Original visuals

Crop directly from the verified original PDF, using alphaXiv's linked PDF for
alphaXiv papers. For a verified arXiv ID, download the source PDF from
`https://arxiv.org/pdf/<id>`. The alphaXiv `/pdf/` URL serves a viewer page,
not the PDF asset; keep user-facing citations pointed at that viewer.
Preserve panel titles, axes, legends, and table headings; exclude the printed
caption and surrounding prose. Render legibly and inspect
the crop. Do not substitute thumbnails, redraw results, or generate lookalikes.
If extraction fails, inspect the error and try available PDF tooling; report
an unresolved obstacle rather than silently omitting the figure.

Save crops durably in the session working tree. Use the figure component with
brief accessible alt text and a contextual caption in the Markdown title:

```markdown
![Architecture overview](paper/figure1.png "Figure 1. What this shows and why it matters. [p. 6](https://www.alphaxiv.org/pdf/PAPER_ID?page=6)")
```

Replace example values with verified paths, IDs, and pages. Base your caption
on the original, tailor it to the question, and preserve important qualifications.
It is your explanation, not an author quote. Do not bake it into the image or
repeat it below the component.

Embed each underlying file once per conversation. Later references use
`[Figure 1](paper/figure1.png)` or `[Table 1](paper/table1.png)` to open the same
local file in the right pane. Different crops/edits may be embedded; renaming an
unchanged image does not make it new. Keep paper-provenance links separate.

## Quotes and citations

Ground claims in original evidence and distinguish your interpretation.
Use direct quotations to ground authors' reasoning, methods, assumptions, and
limitations instead of paraphrasing them all. Choose complete sentences or
self-contained passages. Read surrounding context; isolated
numbers and clipped phrases are not sufficient. Do not quote values already
clear in a displayed visual. Cite immediately after a quote.

Quote only original text you actually read, including full-text snippets with
sufficient context—not generated reports or summaries. Preserve wording and
qualifications; mark omissions and never join separate snippets into a continuous
quote. Respect quotation limits by selecting fewer complete passages, not by
clipping context. If exact evidence is unavailable, say so; never fabricate it
or present a paraphrase as a quotation.

Prefer `https://www.alphaxiv.org/pdf/<paper-id>?page=N` when alphaXiv contains
the cited version and evidence. N is the verified one-based PDF page index;
omit it when unknown. Do not substitute different preprint results for a journal
version. Use another verified paper viewer when alphaXiv lacks that evidence
or is disabled. Raw PDFs are for extraction, not user-facing citations.
Do not cite abstract pages or invent exact-passage highlighting URL parameters.
For discovery results without an alphaXiv representation, link a DOI to
`https://doi.org/<doi>`, a bare OpenAlex `W…` ID to
`https://openalex.org/<id>`, or a PMID to
`https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/<pmid>/`. Never substitute an arXiv link for
an available alphaXiv representation.

| Reference | Label | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One paper, page known | `p. N` | Paper viewer at that PDF page |
| Multiple papers | `Short title, p. N` | Corresponding paper/page |
| Page unknown | `Paper` or consistent short title | Paper viewer without page |
| Embedded visual | `Figure N` / `Table N` | Existing local image file |

Use these labels consistently, not vague labels such as "Source" or descriptions
of the claim. Disambiguate figures by paper when needed. Introductory paper-title links can
retain their titles. Discovery and figure-provenance links provide navigation;
they do not imply every claim in a paper has been verified.
