# BigQuery Troubleshooting: On-Demand Compute Spend & Query Scans

<!-- disableFinding(LINK_RELATIVE_G3DOC) -->

This reference guide provides root-cause mapping and remediation strategies for
BigQuery On-Demand compute cost spikes, query scan volume growth, and runaway
queries. It focuses strictly on On-Demand compute billable usage
(`total_bytes_billed` converted to TiB in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`). Each
section connects the observed symptom to potential root causes and points to the
corresponding query in `bigquery-observability`.

## 1. 4-Step Diagnostic Funnel

When investigating on-demand compute cost questions (e.g., *"Why did our
on-demand query bill spike?"*, *"Who scanned the most data last week?"*, or
Month-over-Month comparisons):

1.  **Step 1: Context Resolution & Baseline Scan (Gather)**

    *   **Scope Resolution:** Identify the target `project_id`, `region`, and
        requested analysis timeframe.
    *   **Time Window & Baseline:** Default to a standard **7-day
        Period-over-Period (PoP)** window comparing the last 7 days against the
        preceding 7 days (`CURRENT_DATE() - 7` to `CURRENT_DATE() - 14`) if
        unspecified; otherwise evaluate the user's requested timeframe against
        its corresponding prior baseline period (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`
        retains 180 days).
    *   **Baseline Scan:** Query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` for total billed TiB
        aligned to Pacific Time (`PST8PDT`).
    *   **Compute Model Check & Zero-Row Test:** If the baseline query returns 0
        rows, STOP. Do not compute aggregates over an empty set. Automatically
        check if the project runs on Capacity/Editions (inspect `reservation_id`
        in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` or check `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENTS`).
        If assigned to a reservation, route to
        `references/cost_compute_capacity.md`. Otherwise, prompt the user to
        confirm the active region and project scope before proceeding.
    *   **Report Factually:** State the percentage increase and the exact TiB
        volume movement before diagnosing root causes.

2.  **Step 2: Vector Decomposition & Anomaly Isolation (Isolate)**

    *   Deconstruct total billed bytes across:
        *   **Query Frequency / Volume:** An increase in total executed jobs
            across automated pipelines.
        *   **The Bully Query:** A single expensive query scanning terabytes or
            petabytes unconstrained.
        *   **BQML Model Training:** `CREATE MODEL` operations under On-Demand
            pricing that bill processed bytes at specialized model training
            rates.
        *   **Hidden RLS Redactions:** Queries against Row-Level Security tables
            returning `NULL` in `total_bytes_billed`.

3.  **Step 3: Event & Query Correlation (Explain Root Cause)**

    *   Group `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` by `user_email`,
        `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals`, and `statement_type` (and
        include `project_id` when querying organization or folder views).
    *   Identify the top contributing queries, executing actors (user or service
        account), and execution timestamps.

4.  **Step 4: Actionable Remediation & Customer Levers (Remediate)**

    *   Deliver concrete, immediate mitigation levers (enforcing partition
        filters, setting query billing caps, and optimizing query syntax) as
        detailed in the matching scenario below.

## 2. Diagnostic Workflows by Symptom & Root Cause

### Scenario 1: The Bully Query (Unpartitioned Runaway Scan)

*   **When to Use / Symptoms:** A sudden spike in daily On-Demand billed bytes
    attributable to a few single massive queries scanning large volumes of data
    unconstrained.
*   **Potential Root Causes:** Sub-optimal query design in general, including
    missing partition pruning predicates (`WHERE _PARTITIONDATE >= ...`),
    missing cluster filters, unconstrained `SELECT *` scans, non-selective or
    cross joins, or repeated full-table scans across multi-terabyte tables.
*   **Key Telemetry & Tables:**
    *   **Table:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`.
    *   **Filters:** `job_type = 'QUERY'`, `statement_type != 'SCRIPT'`,
        `creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(...)`.
    *   **Key Fields:** `project_id` (crucial for org/folder-level views),
        `job_id`, `user_email`, `total_bytes_billed`, `total_bytes_processed`,
        `statement_type`, `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals`.
*   **Diagnostic Procedure & Telemetry:** See **Telemetry & Data Retrieval
    Reference** below to calculate canonical billed TiB, account for BQML
    multipliers, and sort by spend descending. Group by
    `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals` to identify recurring
    scheduled queries accumulating unbounded spend.
*   **Remediation & Actions:**
    *   **Enforce Partition Filtering:** Require partition filters on large
        tables:
        *   *DDL:* `ALTER TABLE {dataset_id}.{table_id} SET OPTIONS
            (require_partition_filter = true);`
        *   *CLI:* `bq update --require_partition_filter=true
            {project_id}:{dataset_id}.{table_id}`
    *   **Set Query Billing Caps:** Set a maximum byte limit to prevent rogue
        scans:
        *   *CLI:* `bq query --use_legacy_sql=false
            --maximum_bytes_billed=107374182400 "{sql_query}"` (e.g., 100 GB
            cap).
        *   *Client Libraries:* Set `job_config.maximum_bytes_billed =
            107374182400` in `QueryJobConfig`.
    *   **Optimize Query Syntax:** Add partition pruning filters and select only
        required columns instead of `SELECT *`.

### Scenario 2: Hidden RLS Redacted Costs

*   **When to Use / Symptoms:** Queries return `NULL` in `total_bytes_billed` in
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`, causing standard sum queries to undercount spend
    and creating an apparent discrepancy with the Cloud Billing invoice.
*   **Potential Root Causes:** Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are active on
    the scanned tables. BigQuery masks `total_bytes_billed` to prevent inferring
    filtered row counts or data distributions from scan sizes.
*   **Key Telemetry & Tables:**
    *   **Tables:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`,
        `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROW_ACCESS_POLICIES`.
    *   **Filters:** `job_type = 'QUERY'`, `total_bytes_billed IS NULL`,
        `error_result IS NULL`.
    *   **Key Fields:** `project_id` (for org/folder-level views), `job_id`,
        `user_email`, `referenced_tables`, `total_bytes_processed`.
*   **Diagnostic Procedure & Telemetry:** Count the volume of redacted queries
    in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` where `total_bytes_billed IS NULL` and
    `error_result IS NULL`. See **Telemetry & Data Retrieval Reference** below
    to audit active row access filters on referenced tables.
*   **Remediation & Actions:**
    *   **Audit Service Account Access:** For automated ETL/BI service accounts
        requiring full table data, grant appropriate table-level permissions or
        use authorized views/raw tables without row access policies so scan
        sizes are unmasked.
    *   **Reconcile with Billing Reports:** Use Google Cloud Billing Reports
        grouped by SKU (`Analysis`) to track complete financial invoice amounts
        including RLS-redacted queries.

### Scenario 3: BQML Model Training Rates

*   **When to Use / Symptoms:** Billed bytes or invoice costs are significantly
    higher than scanned bytes for specific queries due to machine learning
    training workloads.
*   **Potential Root Causes:** In On-Demand pricing, `CREATE MODEL` operations
    for certain built-in ML algorithms (such as Deep Neural Networks, Matrix
    Factorization, or AutoML) are billed at specialized rates on processed
    bytes.
*   **Key Telemetry & Tables:**
    *   **Table:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`.
    *   **Filters:** `statement_type = 'CREATE_MODEL'`.
    *   **Key Fields:** `project_id` (for org/folder-level views), `job_id`,
        `user_email`, `total_bytes_processed`, `total_bytes_billed`,
        `statement_type`.
*   **Diagnostic Procedure & Telemetry:** Filter `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` for
    `statement_type = 'CREATE_MODEL'` (following guidance in **Telemetry & Data
    Retrieval Reference** below) to evaluate model training byte volume and
    isolate top model training queries.
*   **Remediation & Actions:**
    *   **Pre-materialize Training Sets:** Filter and materialize feature
        datasets into intermediate tables to minimize repeated full table scans
        during iterative training.
    *   **Evaluate Capacity Model:** For frequent or heavy ML model training,
        evaluate whether running workloads under BigQuery Editions (where model
        training consumes slot capacity rather than on-demand byte multipliers)
        is more cost-effective.

### Scenario 4: User / Service Account Bursting & Missing Quotas

*   **When to Use / Symptoms:** A sudden day-over-day spike in total billed
    bytes spread across hundreds or thousands of automated queries from a
    specific identity.
*   **Potential Root Causes:** Newly deployed CI/CD pipeline, unthrottled
    notebook, or automated script executing high-concurrency unpruned queries.
*   **Key Telemetry & Tables:**
    *   **Table:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`.
    *   **Key Fields:** `project_id`, `user_email`, `creation_time`,
        `total_bytes_billed`, `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals`.
*   **Diagnostic Procedure & Telemetry:** Group `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` by
    `user_email` and daily date partition to isolate the identity driving the
    surge (following guidance in **Telemetry & Data Retrieval Reference**
    below). Group by `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals` for that user
    to identify the specific bursting script.
*   **Remediation & Actions:**
    *   **Configure Cloud Quotas:** Set custom daily query usage limits in the
        Google Cloud Console under **IAM & Admin** > **Quotas & System
        Limits** > **BigQuery API**:
        *   `Query usage per day` (project-level cap).
        *   `Query usage per day per user` (prevents a single rogue script from
            exhausting the budget).
    *   **Project Workload Isolation:** Separate automated pipelines from ad-hoc
        analytical users into separate GCP projects with distinct quota limits.

### Scenario 5: Querying Very Small Tables (10 MiB Minimum Billed Data Floor)

*   **When to Use / Symptoms:** Queries against very small tables (even
    kilobyte-sized reference or status tables) result in disproportionately high
    on-demand compute charges.
*   **Potential Root Causes:** Under BigQuery On-Demand pricing, the minimum
    billed processed data per referenced table in a query is **10 MiB**,
    regardless of actual table size. Likewise, the minimum billed processed data
    per query is **10 MiB**. Automated loops, health probes, or ETL scripts
    querying tiny lookup tables hundreds of times per hour accumulate billable
    bytes rapidly (e.g. 10,000 queries = ~100 GB billed).
*   **Key Telemetry & Tables:**
    *   **Tables:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`.
    *   **Key Fields:** `project_id`, `job_id`, `user_email`,
        `total_bytes_billed`, `total_bytes_processed`, `referenced_tables`.
*   **Diagnostic Procedure & Telemetry:** Filter `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` for
    queries where `total_bytes_billed = 10485760` (10 MiB) or where
    `total_bytes_processed < 10485760` but `total_bytes_billed = 10485760`
    (following guidance in **Telemetry & Data Retrieval Reference** below).
    Count the frequency of these small queries and inspect `referenced_tables`
    to isolate the target lookup tables.
*   **Remediation & Actions:**
    *   **Application-Side Caching:** Cache lookup or configuration tables in
        application memory or Memorystore rather than querying BigQuery
        repeatedly.
    *   **Batch Invocations:** Consolidate frequent individual lookups into
        batched queries using `IN (...)` or joins.
    *   **Evaluate BigQuery Editions:** For workloads that require
        high-frequency lightweight lookups, route the project to BigQuery
        Editions, where compute is billed by slot capacity rather than per-query
        10 MiB minimums.
