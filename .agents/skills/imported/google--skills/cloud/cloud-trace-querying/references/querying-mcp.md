# Querying Traces via MCP Tools

This page documents how to query and analyze traces using Model Context Protocol
(MCP) tools.

## Registered MCP Tools

When the Cloud Trace MCP server is configured and connected, the following tools
become available to the agent environment:

### 1. `list_traces`

*   **Description**: Lists traces in the target GCP project that match a v1
    filter query expression.
*   **Arguments**:
    *   `filter` (string, optional): The filter expression (e.g. `latency:2s`).
    *   `pageSize` (integer, optional): Maximum number of traces to return
        (default is 100).
    *   `startTime` (string, optional): Query start time.
    *   `endTime` (string, optional): Query end time.

### 2. `get_trace`

*   **Description**: Retrieves all spans associated with a specific trace ID.
*   **Arguments**:
    *   `traceId` (string, required): The 32-character hex trace ID.

## Guidance: Scripts vs. MCP Tools

*   **Use Local Script Utilities** (`search_traces`, `fetch_entire_trace`,
    `fetch_related_logs`) as the default entry point. Scripts are optimized to
    format results cleanly and filter out redundant fields, preventing context
    window bloat in the agent environment.
*   **Use MCP Tools** (`list_traces`, `get_trace`) if running in an external
    client environment without access to a local shell or script repository, or
    when using automated MCP tool registries that inject standard query actions.
    Note that MCP endpoints might have permissions/access in sandboxed
    environments that local scripts do not have access to.
