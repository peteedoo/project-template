## 1. Decision Matrix: Partitioning vs. Clustering vs. Hybrid

<!-- mdformat off -->
| Dimension | Partitioning (`PARTITION BY`) | Clustering (`CLUSTER BY`) | Hybrid (`PARTITION BY` + `CLUSTER BY`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | Low-cardinality values, temporal/date boundaries, date-based TTL retention. | High-cardinality values, multiple filter/group-by columns, frequent DML modifications. | Large temporal tables with multi-dimensional filtering (e.g., date + tenant/status). |
| **Pruning Mechanism** | **Partition Pruning:** Whole partitions are eliminated from scanning before execution. | **Block Pruning:** Capacitor data blocks within files are skipped dynamically during execution. | Two-tier pruning: Partition pruning narrows the time window, then block pruning skips blocks within partitions. |
| **Cost Estimation** | Known deterministically before query execution via dry-run (`totalBytesProcessed`). | Estimated dynamically during execution as blocks are evaluated. | Upfront partition scan bounds with execution-time block savings. |
| **Storage Lifecycle** | Unlocks **partition-level TTL** and 90-day long-term 50% storage price discount. | No partition-level expiration (data is co-located across storage blocks). | Enables partition TTL retention while optimizing intra-partition query performance. |
| **Limits** | Up to **10,000 partitions per table**. | Up to **4 clustering columns** per table. | 10,000 partition limit applies; clustering operates within each partition. |

## 2. Partitioning Design Principles

### Partitioning Types by Column Type

*   **`TIMESTAMP` Column:** `PARTITION BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(column_name, DAY)`
*   **`DATE` Column:** `PARTITION BY date_column` (or for monthly granularity:
    `PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC(date_column, MONTH)`)
*   **`DATETIME` Column:** `PARTITION BY DATETIME_TRUNC(datetime_column, DAY)`
*   **Ingestion-Time Partitioning:** BigQuery assigns rows to partitions based
    on the ingestion time using the pseudo-column `_PARTITIONDATE` /
    `_PARTITIONTIME`.
*   **Integer-Range Partitioning:** Partition by an `INT64` column using
    `RANGE_BUCKET(column, GENERATE_ARRAY(start, end, interval))`.

### Core Partitioning Invariants & Rules

*   **10,000 Partition Quota Limit:** Each partitioned table can have up to
    10,000 partitions. If a table reaches or approaches this limit:
    *   *Solution:* Widen the partition time unit (e.g., switch from `HOUR` to
        `DAY`, or `DAY` to `MONTH`) and **cluster on the granular time column**
        (e.g. partition by month, cluster by timestamp). BigQuery automatically
        clusters data blocks within each partition.
*   **Enforce Partition Pruning (`require_partition_filter = true`):** For large
    tables, always set `require_partition_filter = true` to force queries to
    supply a partition predicate in the `WHERE` clause, preventing accidental
    multi-terabyte unpruned full-table scans.
*   **Avoid Over-Partitioning:** Do not create hourly partitions for low-volume
    tables. Partitioning that results in a small amount of data per partition
    (approximately less than 10 GB) increases the table's metadata, and can
    affect metadata access times when querying the table.
*   **Long-Term Storage Discount:** Partitions that are not modified for 90
    consecutive days automatically qualify for **50% cheaper long-term storage**
    pricing.

## 3. Clustering Design Principles

### Clustering Rules & Mechanics

*   **Up to 4 High-Cardinality Filtering & Grouping Columns:** Specify up to 4
    high-cardinality filtering and grouping columns (`WHERE` filters and `GROUP
    BY` keys) in the `CLUSTER BY` clause.
*   **Column Ordering is Critical:** BigQuery clusters data hierarchically based
    on the order of columns specified:
    *   Place the **most frequently filtered column** or the column with
        **equality filters** first (`col1`).
    *   Place secondary filter columns, range filter columns, or `GROUP
        BY`/`JOIN` keys next (`col2`, `col3`, `col4`).
    *   *Trap:* Filtering on `col2` without a predicate on `col1` significantly
        diminishes block pruning effectiveness.
*   **Supported Data Types:** `STRING` (first 1,024 characters), `INT64`,
    `NUMERIC`, `BIGNUMERIC`, `BOOL`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, `DATETIME`,
    `GEOGRAPHY`, `RANGE`.
*   **Automatic Re-Clustering:** BigQuery performs continuous, fully-managed
    background reclustering to maintain block sortedness as new data is appended
    or modified, at **zero slot cost**.

## 4. Production DDL Templates

### Recommended Hybrid Pattern (Partition + Cluster)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `{project_id}.{dataset_id}.events`
(
  event_id STRING,
  customer_id STRING,
  event_type STRING,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  payload JSON
)
-- Partition by DATE, TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, or INT64 range column:
PARTITION BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(event_timestamp, DAY)
-- Cluster on up to 4 high-cardinality filtering and grouping columns:
CLUSTER BY customer_id, event_type
OPTIONS (
  require_partition_filter = true,
  partition_expiration_days = 365,
  description = 'High-volume events partitioned by day and clustered by customer'
);
```

### Migrating an Existing Unpartitioned Table to Partitioned

You cannot directly convert an existing non-partitioned table to a partitioned
table via `ALTER TABLE`, and it is not possible to use the `OR REPLACE` modifier
to replace a table with a different kind of partitioning. Instead, use a `CREATE
TABLE ... PARTITION BY ... CLUSTER BY ... AS SELECT * FROM ...` (CTAS) statement
to create a new partitioned table by querying the data in the existing table (or
`DROP` the table first and then recreate it)—partitioning by a `DATE`,
`TIMESTAMP`, `DATETIME`, or `INT64` (`RANGE_BUCKET`) column, clustering on up to
4 high-cardinality filtering and grouping columns (`WHERE` and `GROUP BY`), and
setting `require_partition_filter = true`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `{project_id}.{dataset_id}.events_partitioned`
  -- Partition by DATE, TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, or INT64 range column:
  PARTITION BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(event_timestamp, DAY)
  -- Cluster on up to 4 high-cardinality filtering and grouping columns:
  CLUSTER BY customer_id, event_type
  OPTIONS (require_partition_filter = TRUE)
AS
SELECT * FROM `{project_id}.{dataset_id}.events_unpartitioned`;
```

### Modifying the Clustering Specification

Apply a new clustering specification to unpartitioned or partitioned tables in
two steps. First, update the clustering specification of the table to match the
new clustering:

```bash
bq update --clustering_fields=customer_id,status \
  {project_id}:{dataset_id}.{table_id}
```

The `--clustering_fields` value is a comma-separated list of column names to use
for clustering.

Then, to cluster all rows according to the new clustering specification, run the
following `UPDATE` statement. Propose this statement to the user rather than
running it directly:

```sql
UPDATE `{project_id}.{dataset_id}.{table_id}`
SET customer_id = customer_id
WHERE true;
```

The `UPDATE` must supply a partition filter if the table has
`require_partition_filter = true`, and a single job cannot modify more than
4,000 partitions (the per-job modification limit). For partitioned tables,
re-cluster in bounded batches:

```sql
UPDATE `{project_id}.{dataset_id}.{table_id}`
SET customer_id = customer_id
WHERE {partition_column} >= '{range_start}'
  AND {partition_column} < '{range_end}';
```

Repeat over consecutive ranges of fewer than 4,000 partitions until the whole
table is covered.

Tell the user that applying a new clustering specification to a table in
long-term storage reverts that table to
[active storage pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#storage-pricing).

## 5. Table Design & Recommendation Workflow (Given a Table or Schema)

When asked to recommend a partitioning and clustering strategy for a specific
table or schema:

1.  **Step 1: Identify Partitioning Key & Time Granularity**

    *   *Audit Existing Table Configuration:* Before proposing changes, check
        `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` (`is_partitioning_column = 'YES'`,
        `data_type`, `clustering_ordinal_position`) and
        `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_OPTIONS` (`option_name =
        'require_partition_filter'`) for the target dataset, or run `bq show
        --format=prettyjson {project_id}:{dataset_id}.{table_id}`
        (`timePartitioning`, `rangePartitioning`, `clustering`,
        `requirePartitionFilter`) to confirm whether the table already has
        `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATETIME`, or `INT64` integer-range partitioning,
        clustering columns, and partition filter enforcement.
    *   *Scan Column Types:* Look for `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, or `DATETIME` columns
        representing primary event generation time.
    *   *Check the 10,000 Partition Quota Limit:*
        *   **`DAY` Partitioning (Default):** Optimal for 1–7 year lifespans
            (~365 to ~2,555 partitions).
        *   **`HOUR` Partitioning:** Choose it only for tables with a high
            volume of data spanning a short date range — typically less than six
            months of timestamp values. Make sure the resulting partition count
            stays within the 10,000 partition limit.
        *   **`MONTH` or `YEAR` Partitioning:** For historical archives (>10
            years), partition by `MONTH` and cluster by the timestamp.
    *   *No Temporal Column:* Evaluate integer range partitioning
        (`RANGE_BUCKET`) for incremental IDs, or ingestion-time partitioning
        (`_PARTITIONTIME`) for append-only log streams.

2.  **Step 2: Select & Order Clustering Columns (Up to 4 Columns)**

    *   *Candidate Columns:* High-cardinality dimension columns frequently
        present in `WHERE` equality filters, `JOIN ON` clauses, or `GROUP BY`
        aggregations (e.g., `customer_id`, `organization_id`, `status`).
    *   *Column Ordering Rules:*
        *   `col1`: The most frequently filtered column or equality/tenant
            identifier (`customer_id`).
        *   `col2`, `col3`: Secondary dimensions or range filter attributes
            (`event_type`, `created_at`).
        *   *Order Trap:* Queries filtering on `col2` without a predicate on
            `col1` cannot perform efficient block pruning.

3.  **Step 3: Output Production DDL & Guardrails**

    *   Generate complete `CREATE TABLE` DDL, including CTAS migrations. To
        modify a table's clustering specification, use the two-step sequence in
        Section 4.
    *   Add `require_partition_filter = true` (`ALTER TABLE
        {dataset_id}.{table_id} SET OPTIONS (require_partition_filter = true)`)
        for high-volume production tables to prevent accidental unpruned
        full-table scans.
    *   Add `partition_expiration_days = N` for staging, ETL, or rolling log
        tables to automate data cleanup.

## 6. Table Design Anti-Patterns & Architecture Constraints

-   **`ALTER TABLE` Partitioning Invariant:** BigQuery **does not support
    altering an existing unpartitioned table to become partitioned**. You must
    create a new partitioned table using CTAS or a load job. `ALTER TABLE` does
    not support setting or changing a table's clustering; use `bq update
    --clustering_fields` (Section 4).
-   **Small-Partition Anti-Pattern (<10 GB per Partition):** Prefer clustering
    over partitioning when partitioning would yield **less than ~10 GB per
    partition**. Creating many small partitions inflates table metadata and
    slows metadata access at query time without yielding scan savings.
    *(Separately, on-demand query compute charges enforce a 10 MiB data
    processed minimum per referenced table and per query, regardless of table or
    partition size).*
-   **1,024-Character String Limit:** For `STRING` clustering columns, BigQuery
    evaluates only the **first 1,024 characters** for block pruning. Do not
    cluster on long free-text descriptions or raw JSON payloads; extract concise
    identifiers.
-   **Streaming Buffer Compaction (`__UNPARTITIONED__`):** Rows recently
    streamed via the BigQuery Storage Write API initially reside in the
    `__UNPARTITIONED__` partition with a `NULL` `_PARTITIONTIME`. These rows
    cannot be pruned by partition filters until extracted into permanent
    partitions by BigQuery's background compaction.
-   **Query Filter Optimization:** To leverage partition and clustering pruning
    effectively in query execution, predicates must use compile-time constants.
    For query-level `WHERE`-clause rewrites and function anti-patterns, refer to
    the `bigquery-optimization` skill.

## 7. Telemetry & Data Retrieval Reference

If the `bigquery-observability` skill is available in your workspace, refer to
its shared telemetry references for canonical query templates and schema
dictionaries. All essential table design workflows, DDL templates, and
remediation levers are self-contained within this guide.

*   **Table Partitioning, Clustering & Filter Enforcement Audit:** See the
    `bigquery-observability` skill (`references/storage_footprints.md`, section
    "Table Partitioning, Clustering & Filter Enforcement Audit") to query
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_OPTIONS` for
    unpartitioned tables, partitioning column types, clustering columns, and
    `require_partition_filter`.
*   **High-Scan Referenced Tables Discovery:** See the `bigquery-observability`
    skill (`references/compute_ondemand_billable.md`, section "CORE RULE: The
    Golden Base CTE (bytes_billed_cte)") to group
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT` by
    `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals` for exact job-level
    `total_bytes_billed` and `total_bytes_processed` attribution, and unnest
    `referenced_tables` to discover candidate tables (do not sum job-level bytes
    across multi-table joins; cross-check candidate table size via
    `total_logical_bytes` in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE` before
    recommending partitioning).
